Data
----

The following data should be stored for each file:
- name
- size
- full path (relative to scan point)
- a number of hashes (md5, sha-1, xxh32, xxh64, git-sha, ssdeep, sdhash, ...)
- basename
- extension
- dirname

Less useful data that can also be stored:
 - permissions
 - dates (creation, modification, access)

Each database should also keep track
of all the commands (scans) that were used
to add content.

The data model should be extensible
(for example, more hashes may be added in later versions),
so the data storage should take this parameter into account.
