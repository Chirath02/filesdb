Commands
--------

The exact set of commands is a work in progress.

However, the following should give a reasonable first approach.

The commands can be implemented as subcommands,
like in git.

h|help			provide help
v|version		display the software version
l|list			list all scans in a database
st|stats		display statistics about the DB contents
sc|scan			scan a location and add to the database
qs|quickscan		quick-scan a location (ignore hashes) and add to the DB
f|find|s|search:	search for a file, according to criteria
