Storage
-------

All the information is stored into an SQL database.

Individual SQLite files seem to be
the perfect point between functionality and complexity,
allowing all operations on data
and easy transfer between systems.

All the command-line utilities should accept
a "-d|--database <arg>" to specify the location
of this file.
